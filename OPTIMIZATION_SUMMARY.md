## 📊 Expected Improvements

| Metric | Before | Expected After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Performance Score** | 86/100 | 92-95/100 | +6-9 points |
| **FCP** | 3.0s | 1.6-2.0s | ~40% faster |
| **LCP** | 3.0s | 2.0-2.4s | ~30% faster |
| **Speed Index** | 4.9s | 3.0-3.5s | ~35% faster |
| **Main Thread** | Long tasks | Reduced | Smoother interaction |

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

1. **Build optimized version:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Run performance test:**
   ```bash
   npm run perf:test
   ```

3. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

4. **Verify with PageSpeed Insights:**
   - Test at: https://pagespeed.web.dev/
   - URL: https://dhirendrasinghdhami.com.np/

## 🎯 Key Optimization Strategies Applied

- ✅ **Code Splitting**: Better vendor chunks for caching
- ✅ **Lazy Loading**: Non-critical components deferred  
- ✅ **Resource Hints**: Preload, prefetch, preconnect
- ✅ **Bundle Size**: Aggressive compression and minification
- ✅ **Cache Strategy**: Long-term caching for static assets
- ✅ **Critical Path**: Inline critical CSS and early loading
- ✅ **Hardware Acceleration**: GPU-accelerated animations

## 📈 Next Steps

1. Deploy changes and test with PageSpeed Insights
2. Monitor Core Web Vitals over time
3. Consider additional image optimization if needed
4. Implement Service Worker for even better caching (optional)
